# Hybrid-Anomaly-Detection-with-Dimensional-Constraints-HAD-DC-Methodology
Hybrid Anomaly Detection with Dimensional Constraints (HAD-DC) detects both visual and dimensional anomalies in MVTec AD metal nuts. It combines an autoencoder-based visual detector with camera calibrationâ€“based dimensional checks, producing a hybrid anomaly score for robust quality inspection.
